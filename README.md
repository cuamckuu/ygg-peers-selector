# Yggdrasil Optimal Peers Selector

> Tired of hunting down the best peers? Well, you're in luck - here's a tool just for you!

Instead of manually checking the [list of public peers](https://publicpeers.neilalexander.dev) in the [Yggdrasil Network](https://yggdrasil-network.github.io) and guessing which ones are fast, simply use this tool to ping them and let it select the best peers based on response time.

Less hassle, more speed!
